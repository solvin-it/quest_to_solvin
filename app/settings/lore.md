# The First Gods

In the beginning, there were The First, the Creator, who brought forth two divine beings: The One Who Governs Life, Vita, and The One Who Governs The Laws, Lex. These two entities would go on to become the first gods, entrusted with the monumental task of crafting an entire world.

## The Creation

Vita and Lex embarked on their cosmic collaboration to sculpt a realm where life could flourish. Lex, in his wisdom, commenced by birthing fundamental concepts â€“ light and darkness, gravity, and the elusive mana. These concepts laid the foundation for the natural laws that would govern this nascent world. Meanwhile, Vita, with her nurturing spirit, forged the first pantheon of gods. These divine beings were assigned the solemn duty of overseeing life and safeguarding the mortals who would later inhabit this burgeoning realm.

## Rise of Kingdoms

As time unfurled, the world bore witness to the rise of mighty kingdoms and civilizations. These burgeoning societies flourished under the watchful gaze of Vita's pantheon, each kingdom carving its own unique path through history. From the enchanting elven realms deep within ancient forests to the grand citadels of human empires, the world teemed with diversity and wonder.

## The First Great War

Yet, like shadows creeping in the twilight, conflict inevitably loomed over this world of splendor. The First Great War erupted as kingdoms clashed, driven by ambition, jealousy, and the desire for power. The gods of Vita's pantheon were torn between their loyalties, and the mortals faced the horrors of war on an unprecedented scale. The cataclysmic conflict reshaped the lands and left scars that would linger for generations.

## The Thousand-Year Peace

Following the devastation of the First Great War, a weary world sought solace in a millennium of peace. This era, known as the Thousand-Year Peace, allowed civilizations to rebuild and rekindle their connections. During this respite, arts and knowledge flourished, and the scars of war began to fade. However, the looming specter of conflict never truly dissipated.

## The Empire

Amidst the peace, one empire arose to prominence, known for its unmatched military prowess, technological innovation, and unquenchable thirst for expansion. The Empire, led by formidable leaders and governed by ruthless pragmatism, cast its shadow over the world. Its reach extended far and wide, bringing both prosperity and oppression to those who fell under its rule.

## The Second Great War

The fragile peace of a thousand years shattered with the outbreak of the Second Great War. The empire's insatiable hunger for dominance ignited a global conflagration, drawing in kingdoms, races, and gods into a conflict of unparalleled scale. As the world once again plunged into chaos, the fate of Solvin hung in the balance.
