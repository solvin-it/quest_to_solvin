# Quest to Solvin

Quest to Solvin is a unique personal project that brings the world of medieval fantasy RPGs to life through the use of a chatbot. In this interactive experience, users can engage with the chatbot to uncover the rich environment and background story of the game world, interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), and embark on personalized quests.

## Project Overview

Quest to Solvin is an experimental project that leverages the power of language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5, to generate NPCs with distinct personalities that seamlessly fit into the medieval-fantasy theme of the game. Unlike traditional RPGs where quests are pre-written and static, Quest to Solvin aims to create dynamic and personalized quests based on the interactions between the user and the NPC.

## Key Features

- **Immersive World:** Explore a medieval-fantasy world filled with captivating lore, mysterious landscapes, and intriguing characters.

- **Interactive NPCs:** Engage in conversations with lifelike NPCs, each with its own unique personality and background story. The NPCs respond dynamically to user inquiries and interactions.

- **Personalized Quests:** The quests you receive are tailored to the NPC's background and your interactions with them. For example, a blacksmith NPC might task you with gathering iron ores, while a village chief NPC may ask you to rescue captured villagers from bandits or orcs.

- **Quest Details:** Each quest is thoughtfully crafted and includes essential information, such as the quest's background, objectives, success conditions, failure conditions, and rewards.

## Inspiration

Quest to Solvin draws inspiration from popular isekai and game-like stories where the protagonist receives a system that quantifies their attributes and issues quests. In this project, we aim to capture the essence of these narratives and provide users with an immersive RPG experience where they can embark on adventures, interact with intriguing characters, and shape the destiny of the game world.
